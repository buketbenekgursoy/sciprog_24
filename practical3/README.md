pi/3 Radians = 1.047198

Initial area (sum at x(0) and x(12)) = 1.732051
New area of x(1) = 1.907028
New area of x(2) = 2.259682
New area of x(3) = 2.795581
New area of x(4) = 3.523521
New area of x(5) = 4.456137
New area of x(6) = 5.610837
New area of x(7) = 7.011252
New area of x(8) = 8.689451
New area of x(9) = 10.689451
New area of x(10) = 13.072958
New area of x(11) = 15.929254
The value of the sum after the loop is: 15.929254
